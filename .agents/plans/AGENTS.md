Each directory in .agents/plans will contain:
* an AGENTS.md file providing guidance to the agents who will be implementing the plans.
* markdown files named "$PRIORITY - $TASK.md"
* Each task markdown file will have description, thoughts, details and any other information necessary to direct agents towards the task's completion

Once a task is complete, the markdown file is REMOVED!
